# Brain Tumor Detection using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
The Brain Tumor Detection project aims to develop an efficient and accurate technique for identifying the presence, size, shape, and location of brain tumors in MRI images. Leveraging the power of Machine Learning, this project has been designed to assist medical professionals, particularly doctors, in their diagnostic process. The objective is to create a tool that can enhance the speed and precision of brain tumor detection, thereby aiding in timely and informed medical decisions.

## Features
1. **Automated Tumor Detection**: The system employs advanced Machine Learning algorithms to automatically detect the presence of brain tumors in MRI images.

2. **Size and Shape Analysis**: Our solution provides insights into the size and shape of the identified tumors, offering valuable information for treatment planning.

3. **Location Identification**: The tool is designed to pinpoint the exact location of the detected brain tumors, aiding doctors in understanding the spatial distribution within the brain.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: The project includes a user-friendly interface that allows medical professionals to easily upload MRI images and obtain detailed reports on potential brain tumors.

5. **Efficient Diagnosis Support**: By streamlining the detection process, our system aims to significantly reduce the time required for diagnosis, enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on treatment strategies.

## How it Works
The Brain Tumor Detection system follows a multi-step process:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: MRI images are preprocessed to enhance their quality and make them suitable for analysis.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed images to feed into the Machine Learning model.

3. **Machine Learning Model Training**: A robust Machine Learning model is trained on a dataset of annotated MRI images to learn 5. patterns and characteristics associated with brain tumors.

4. **Tumor Detection and Analysis**: The trained model is then applied to new MRI images for automatic tumor detection, with subsequent analysis of size, shape, and location.

5. **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface allows medical professionals to interact with the system, uploading MRI images and receiving detailed reports.

## Technologies Used
